## Description
This is an implementation of the famous mobile game "Plants vs Zombies". The prime purpose of the game is to defeat the incoming wave of zombies by planting different types of plants. Carefully managing sunflower resources is integral to success in this game. While the original game lets the user decide which type of plant to plant next, this version of the game automatically and randomly generates a stock of a type of plant upon collecting enough sunlight resources. A stock of available plants is maintained.

Key features:
- Web-based GUI that enables smooth user-interaction
- Collision detection and intricate model structures
